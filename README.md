# dotfiles
My personal dotfile setup (WIP)

## What Is?
This is mostly just a collection of useful functions/shortcuts/configuration.  
This is nothing fancy like the cool stuff you'll see on github.com/dotfiles.

## What does?
By running `sh init.sh` it will take all the files (hidden dotfiles) in this directory and copy them over to your root (~).  
After that you'll have some neat things at your disposal.

## Caution!
If you did use this repo, bear in mind that it will overwrite your dotfiles!
Best if used on a new machine, or if you don't have anything you care about in these files.  

**Most importantly**
- .bash_profile
- .gitconfig (has my name in it)
